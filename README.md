## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- BEM

### What I learned

In this project I learnt how to use BEM naming convention and architecture, although its now perfect but my goal is to keep improving my clean code, and in this project I also improving my understanding of using SASS.

### Continued development

I'll keep improving my BEM architecture and SASS, next I'll going to learn more about CSS Grid, Autoprefixes, POSTCSS, and bootstrap in the future.
